<h1>Avio's Realm</h1>
Originally created for a Computer Science 12 class with Steven Xiao and Adrian Chen in 2022, Avio's Realm is a simple 2D platformer made entirely in vanilla Java. The gameplay and visuals were both heavily inspired by Celeste, which will be evident throughout the gameplay. If you want to take a look at the game, take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/jBXXxTG7a9s">this playthrough</a>! (ignore the numerous deaths T-T)

<h1>Game Play and Controls</h1>
Controls are available upon launch of the game, standard WASD movement is used.

<h1>Known Bugs and Glitches</h1>
<h3>Physics Engine</h3>
Due to this project being coded soley within vanilla Java, we did not have access to a pre-existing physics engine to handle collisions and gravity. Thus, we created our own physics engine, which has troubles properly registering collisions when colliding with sprite corners or at high speeds. This is <strong>not</strong> an intended feature (although I've thought about pretending it was), but due a missmatch between the framerate of the user and the physics engine's tickrate.
<h3>Dashing</h3>
Dashing to the left currently does not work (tbh I have no idea why).

<h1>What's Next?</h1>
If you liked this project, thats surprising! Hopefully this is the first of many game's I create! You can find what I'm currently working on, alongside contact info and other projects through my <a href="https://www.danielzhan.com">website</a>! Feel free to get in touch! With that, see you later, future (or past) friend!
